<h1> Daisy Family Salon 👨‍🦱💇‍♂️✂️ </h1>

<p align="justify"> I developed the “Daisy Family Salon” website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, creating a fully responsive and visually engaging design that adapts seamlessly across devices. The platform features a dynamic and interactive user interface, complete with smooth navigation, real-time form validation, and secure database integration for storing and managing booking data. The website also provides a user-friendly service listing system and an intuitive appointment booking experience, ensuring customers can easily explore services, schedule appointments, and interact with the platform without any friction.</p>
